JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
JavaScript Code Style is how we write our code. The best practice is to be clear and consice and always use
indentation. Also to comment on how specific parts of important code work or why the code its there, while still being short and
consice. 

2. What is a Regular Expression?
A Regular expression is a type of object that can detect patterns on different strings.
For example you can check an email string to see if it has all the parts it needs to be a
complete email adress. Like some text before the '@' and some text after, followed by a '.' then 2,4 lettters
after that again.


3. What does the .random() method do?
Math.random() returns a random floating number inclusive of 0 and exclusive of 1.
I.e: 0.32434323443

4. What does the .sort() method do?
The sort method sorts an array alphabetically after converting an array to strings.

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
This makes an array in descending order instead of ascending. (Position wise).

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.

if('20' == 20) return true;     
Because this will try to convert the value to the other data type.

a = 20;
b = 20;

if (a === b)

console.log("Both are the same number!");

newFunction();

Because JavaScript allows blockless code we can come into situations where the function will not run if the statement is not true.
Since the function is now a "part" of the if statement.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?
Objects, Arrays, Strings, Numbers, Booleans and null.

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?
Minifying Javascript is the process of removing unnecessary data in the code structure without actually changing the code thats in use.
It can remove comments, formatting (like indenting), unused code, shortening variables etc.

9. What is a global variable?
A global variable is a variable that is available to all scripts and functions.
